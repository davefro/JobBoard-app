# Welcome on my Website #

The Website is about job board for students as well as employers. This is a static website  with mock data, however in the future the database will be added to a fully functional page.
The website has been designed using:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap

Bootstrap was used to make the three forms:
* Login form
* Sign in form
* Contact form

Thanks to this, the forms adapt to different resolutions and mobile versions.
Flex boxes and media query were also used on the website to make it responsive and friendly for mobile users.
CSS for page styling.
JavaScript was used to make "hamburger menu" for the mobile version.
On the homepage we can also find two searchboxes, where one is used to find a job and the second to find candidates with photo, education, experiences, skills and languages. Each student profile ia s seperate subpage.

## I hope you enjoy using my website.
